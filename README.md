# Student Life OS

Student Life OS is a simple academic decision engine that helps students prioritise assignments based on urgency, difficulty, and time required.

Instead of maintaining static to-do lists, this tool tells the user what to work on next.

## Problem

Students often struggle with deciding which assignment to start first when multiple deadlines are approaching.

This leads to:

- poor time management
- last-minute submissions
- academic stress and burnout

Most existing tools track tasks but do not help with decision-making.

## Solution

Student Life OS calculates a **priority score** using:

- difficulty level
- days remaining
- estimated time required

The score is converted into a clear action:

- Chill you're on track  
- !!Start soon!!  
- 🚨DO THIS NOW  

This allows students to make fast, informed study decisions.
